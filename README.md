___
Method:
A group of people participate in 2 VR scenarios. While one scenario is our base scene to collect our cotroll data, the otherone should be considered as the real stressor scene. In the second scene different mechanics will be added to the scenario, which should have an impact on the stress level of the test subject. The scenes are described down below.
The gaze-behaviour of the subjects is always being recorded by the integrated eye-tracker of the VR-Glasses. After each scene the subjects participate in an survey to collect direct data about their subjective stress level.
___
1st scene: Base Scene with NPCs
To create an offline feeling the characters were build as static players in an idle state. The voice-lines were more like robotic than human.

___
2nd scene: Stressor Scene with real players:
Because I are not actually using real online players in this scene I had to figure out how the experience is different in contrast to an offline scene like the base scene. The following points show how the 2nd scene was set up to build a online environment experience for the test persons.
- Microphone noises
- Random character movement
- Variety of skins
- Name tags above the players
- Connection problems of other players
- Waiting to join the lobby
- Askin inpropriate questions
- Random Giggle
- Interacting with other stuff
- Rude behaviour
